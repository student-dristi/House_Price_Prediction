# House_Price_Prediction
# House Price Predictor using Linear Regression Model
A simple machine learning project using Linear Regression to estimate housing prices based on features from the Boston Housing dataset.

The dataset used is the classic Boston Housing dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.

#Features used:
rm: average number of rooms per dwelling

zn: proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
